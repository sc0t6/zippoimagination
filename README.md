# F.A.Q.


### Will this ever be backported?
Answer: **Most likely yes**

### What do I do if theres a bug?
Answer: **Make an issue on this github** or **send me a text on discord** (mc.zippo) for the bug

### Will this be on other mod loaders?
Answer: **Maybe.** it will be VERY hard but I will try to. If your a developer you can maybe help me :)

### How can I get the items and use the mod?
Answer: It's either you can go in **creative** or just **craft/find them in survival** which is pretty easy to find or craft for some items and others. **Ray Gun and its ammo** is probably the **hardest** on this list.

### Is there gonna be more items/blocks/entities?
Answer: **Yes.** Sometimes though the updates will just be bug fixes or some improvements.
